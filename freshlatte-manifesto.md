FreshLatte Artifacts
				- Product Capability: Each product is a composition of product capabilities that spans across the product. For instance, some of the capabilities for Instagram as a product are photo sharing, finding friends, following friends, publishing ad as a business, setting profile picture and many more.
				- Product Map: The product capabilities has certain hierarchy. As you can see from the example above from Instagram, some of the capabilities are on a lower level compared to others. Creating a map of capabilities and how they related to each other will help documenting your product better. This also helps others understand your product quicker, as they are going to skim your product capabilities top-down in a more structured way.
				- Task: Tasks are unit of work that needs to be done on the product. Task contribute to product capabilities so each task should related a specific product capability in the product map.
				- Initiative: Initiatives are group of tasks that contribute to a broader goal. Groupings are flexible and can be done for different purpose. You can use them to group tasks for a project milestone, or group tasks that goes across many product capabilities e.g. migration tasks, or any other grouping that might make sense for your product.
